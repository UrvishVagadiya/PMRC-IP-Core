# 🚀 PMRC-IP-Core: Parallel Mixed-Radix Conversion IP
### The $$O(\log k)$$ Architectural Breakthrough for Fully Homomorphic Encryption

The **PMRC-IP-Core** is a high-performance hardware and software intellectual property package. It resolves the critical $O(k^2)$ sequential bottleneck in Mixed-Radix Conversion by fundamentally re-deriving the MRC equations into an independent summation structure. This reduces computational latency to a logarithmic scale, enabling real-time commercial deployment of FHE solutions.
